# What Randint does is it accepts two numbers, a lowest and a highest number.
# The values of 0 and 3 gives us the number 0, 3, and 0.
# I Changed the numbers to (0,8) and the results where 1 0 1.
# The difference between Randint and print is that print will continue giving a 3, while Randint stays the same of changes.
